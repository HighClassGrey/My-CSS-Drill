      <p>Dating is a stage of romantic relationships in humans whereby two people <span style="color:blue">meet</span>
                socially with the aim of each assessing the other's suitability as a prospective partner in an intimate
                relationship or marriage. It is a form of courtship, consisting of social activities done by the
                couple, either alone or with others. The protocols and practices of dating, and the terms used to
                describe it, vary considerably from country to country and over time. While the term has several
                meanings, the most frequent usage refers to two people exploring whether they are romantically or
                sexually compatible by participating in dates with the other. With the use of modern technology, people
                can date via telephone or computer or meet in person.</p>

                p>A wedding is a ceremony where two people are united in marriage. Wedding traditions and <span style="color:blue">customs</span>
                vary greatly between cultures, ethnic groups, religions, countries, and social classes.
                            Most weddingceremonies involve an exchange of marriage vows by the couple, presentation of a gift
                            (offering, rings,
                            symbolic item, flowers, money), and a public proclamation of marriage by an authority
                            figure or
                            celebrant. Special wedding garments are often worn, and the ceremony is sometimes followed
                            by a wedding
                            reception. Music, poetry, prayers or readings from religious texts or literature are also
                            commonly
                            incorporated into the ceremony.</p>

                        <p>Employment is a relationship between two parties, usually based on a contract where <span
                                style="color:blue">work</span>
                            is paid for, where one party, which may be a corporation, for profit, not-for-profit
                            organization,
                            co-operative or other entity is the employer and the other is the employee.[1] Employees
                            work in return
                            for payment, which may be in the form of an hourly wage, by piecework or an annual salary,
                            depending on
                            the type of work an employee does or which sector she or he is working in. Employees in
                            some fields or
                            sectors may receive gratuities, bonus payment or stock options. In some types of
                            employment, employees
                            may receive benefits in addition to payment. Benefits can include health insurance,
                            housing, disability
                            insurance or use of a gym. Employment is typically governed by employment laws, regulations
                            or legal
                            contracts.</p>
